# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - The each method is useful when we want to apply something to every element in an array. It also can be used to check through each element to filter through certain desired values.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - I will try running through the practice problems again in the assignment. They actually went smoothly and I even found a way to write the code for the each method in one line if the code block was simple enough. Thinking about it now, I could probably have even simplified challenge two even further!
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - I took way too much time recording a video for the last assignment, this time I decided to record my first attempt and just settled being okay with any errors or awkwardness.
